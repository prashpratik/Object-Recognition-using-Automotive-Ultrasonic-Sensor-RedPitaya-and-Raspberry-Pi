# Object-Recognition-using-Automotive-Ultrasonic-Sensor-RedPitaya-and-Raspberry-Pi
In this project, I have developed an Object Recognition System using Automotive Ultrasonic Sensor, RedPitaya and Raspberry Pi through Machine Learning classifiers and Deep Learning Neural Network.
For this purpose, I have used SRF02 Automotive ultrasonic sensor, Red Pitaya and Raspberry Pi 4 as electronic hardware tools. 
For software part, I have implemented three different object classifiers. These are Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and classification through LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). 
Both Naive Bayes classifier and SVM classifier are Machine Learning algorithms whereas LSTM is an Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network. 
Also, I took three objects for classification â€“ Wall, Human and Car.
